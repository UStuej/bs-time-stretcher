# bs-time-stretcher

This program stretches the space of notes and events and (can) stretch the length of obstacles, if you change the BPM (note:  the BPM that the program uses is the one in the actual level file, i.e. Easy.json, Normal.json, Hard.json, Expert.json, and ExpertPlus.json).

Installing the program:

1. Download and install Python 3.4.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-344.
2. Go to https://github.com/UStuej/bs-time-stretcher/releases and download the latest release's "BSTimeStretcher.py" file.
3. Place the file inside your main Beat Saber Folder ("hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber" for Oculus or "Beat Saber" for SteamVR).

Using the program:

1. Go to the desired level's folder.
2. Click on the difficulty .json file that you want to change the BPM of.
3. Change the value at "_beatsPerMinute" (the number after the ":") to the desired BPM (be sure to keep track of the original BPMs).
4. If you want to chage multiple BPMs, repeat steps 2-3 as needed.
5. Go to your main Beat Saber Folder.
6. Double-click on "BSTimeStretcher.py"
7. Type in the desired level's folder's path (from "CustomSongs") (using /s) and press "Enter" on your keyboard.
8. Type in the original BPM for the given difficulty and press "Enter" on your keyboard.
9. Choose whether (type "y") or not (type "n") to stretch/shrink the obstacles' length for the given difficulty and press "Enter" on your keyboard.
10. Repeat steps 7-9 as needed.
